<p>A paragraph (from Ancient Greek (par√°graphos) 'to write beside') is a self-contained
     unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.
      Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system,
       paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.
